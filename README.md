# SRWorkflow

**SRWorkflow** is a self-used image super-resolution (SR) framework, based on the [BasicSR](https://github.com/XPixelGroup/BasicSR) project, with simplified and customized components. This project provides a simple and efficient workflow for performing image super-resolution tasks, supporting various SR models and image processing operations.

## Features

- **Simplified Design**: Parts of the BasicSR project have been simplified, removing unnecessary components, making the framework lightweight and easy to use.
- **Efficient Workflow**: Provides a streamlined workflow for common image super-resolution tasks such as data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
- **Customizable Configuration**: Supports quick adjustment of training parameters, model architecture, and optimization strategies via configuration files.
- **Modular**: The framework's components (data loading, model definition, loss functions, etc.) are modular and can be flexibly combined to suit different needs.
- **Support for Various Models**: Supports popular SR models like **EDSR**, and more(**TBD...**).
- **Image Super-Resolution Training**: Train SR models using specified architectures.
- **Image Super-Resolution Testing**: Perform inference on low-resolution images using trained models.
- **Data Processing and Preprocessing**: Includes common operations like dataset loading, cropping, scaling, and more.
